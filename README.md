# Girlfriend Mod for Terraria (TModLoader)

A mod that lets you befriend the Lost Girl found in the caves! Instead of her transforming into a Nymph and attacking you, you can use Terraria's emote system to befriend her, romance her, and eventually make her your girlfriend.

## Features

- **Befriend the Lost Girl**: Use a specific sequence of emotes to befriend her instead of fighting
- **Romance System**: Choose dialogue options to increase her affection level
- **Girlfriend Status**: Give her a diamond ring to make her your girlfriend
- **Housing**: Once she's your girlfriend, she can move into a house on the surface
- **Cooking System**: Place a cooking pot in her house and she'll learn to cook, with a 5-minute timer for meals

- Talk to her regularly to increase her affection level
